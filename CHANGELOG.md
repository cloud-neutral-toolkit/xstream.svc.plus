  - Copy correct binary into `/opt/homebrew/bin/xray`
  - Set execution permissions
- Added `url_launcher` plugin support with macOS integration (`url_launcher_macos`)

## 🧪 Known Limitations

- No system tray or background daemon control UI yet
- Tested only on macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon and Intel)

## 🔜 Roadmap

- [ ] GUI for custom route / rule editing
- [ ] Windows and Linux GUI support
